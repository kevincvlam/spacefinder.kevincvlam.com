<h1> How it Works </h1>

<p>
SpaceFinder estimates the busyness 
of a location by using time-series data about the number of active connections at a given
wireless access point.

We're currently running on live data from Robarts Library, and hope to expand
to more public spaces on and off campus in the future. 

Special thanks to the Wireless Network Infrastructure Dept. at the University 
of Toronto for working with us.
